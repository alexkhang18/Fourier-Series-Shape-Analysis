# Fourier-Series-Shape-Analysis
Shape analysis of two-dimensional closed shapes using Fourier Series and Principal Component Analysis. This minimum working examples recreates the results found in Table 3 in the following reference: https://www.palass.org/publications/newsletter/palaeomath-101/palaeomath-part-25-centre-cannot-hold-ii-elliptic-fourier-analysis. 

This minimum working example may be modified to analyze any arbitrary 2D shape including those of biological cells as done in our pre-print here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.15.594418v1.abstract.
