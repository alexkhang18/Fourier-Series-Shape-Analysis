# Fourier-Series-Shape-Analysis
Shape analysis of two-dimensional closed shapes using Fourier Series and Principal Component Analysis. This minimum working examples recreates the work found here: https://www.palass.org/publications/newsletter/palaeomath-101/palaeomath-part-25-centre-cannot-hold-ii-elliptic-fourier-analysis. 

This minimum working example may be modified to analyze any arbitrary 2D shape including biological cells.
