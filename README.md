# Fourier-Series-Shape-Analysis
Shape analysis of two-dimensional closed shapes using Fourier Series and Principal Component Analysis. This minimum working examples recreates the results found in Table 3 in the following reference: https://www.palass.org/publications/newsletter/palaeomath-101/palaeomath-part-25-centre-cannot-hold-ii-elliptic-fourier-analysis. 

This minimum working example may be modified to analyze any arbitrary 2D shape including those of biological cells as done in our pre-print here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.15.594418v1.abstract.

To run this example, download all files and keep them all in the same directory or folder. Simply open MAIN.m in Matlab, press Run, and make sure you change the current directory to the directory containg the code and images. The code should save all Fourier coefficients for each shape as .m files and visualize Eigenshapes along principal axes 1-3.
